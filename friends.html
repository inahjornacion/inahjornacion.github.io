                        <p>To my dearest friends who made me feel I'm not alone in this journey; who cried and laughed with me; who shared their stories to me resulting to a precious friendship, this one is for you.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Thank you for making me smile when I was down and felt like I couldn't survive for a day. I will always remember and treasure the joyful moments we had together just to cheer me up and for giving an advice when I needed them. Thank you for bringing color into my dull world, for always making me feel like I am not alone and that I don't have to dwell in agony. Thank you for the fun times we shared, the times we watched movies in someone's condo, and just be crazy in every parties we got the opportunity to attend to.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Thank you for the adventures that helped me prove to myself that I am stronger than I imagined. Thank you for being there to guide me when I lost sight of my path. Thank you for patiently hearing me out when I was sad or angry or frustrated. You guys are the safe haven I run into when I find it difficult to trust anyone. Thank you, my dear friends. I would not have made it this far without your presence in my life. I will always remember all of you wherever I go. You have become an important person in my life. I'm always grateful for every single second that we've shared together.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You will not be forgotten. I love you!
