                        <p>To the greatest blessing of my life; my hope and strength; my lifetime partners and guardians; and of course my loving FAMILY, this one is for you. Thank you for being my biggest supporters in everything I do, whether it may be dancing, sports, and academics. Thank you for loving me even if I do something bad. Thank you for constantly putting my happiness before your own. Thank you for giving and allowing me for all the opportunities you have given me to reach success. Thank you for giving me people to look up to. I can't ever say this enough, but thank you.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            All of you are the light of my life. All that I am and have, I owe it all to you. You taught me what it means to love unconditionally and how to work hard for something I am passionate about. You are the reason of my faith, and I love walking with Christ with you. Thank you for being my role model and my biggest fan. I can't thank you all enough for our perfect family. You are all my hero. I love you.
